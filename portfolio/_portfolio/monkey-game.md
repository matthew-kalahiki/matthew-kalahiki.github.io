This game is a single player game made using Java and JavaFX without the use of a game engine. The game follows the player's monkey in a journey across the jungle defeating other monkeys using coconut projectiles and various helpful items to assert its jungle dominance. 

This is a round-based game in which the player attempts to defeat all of the CPU monkeys, with each enemy monkey containing a unique set of items to provide the player with an intriguing variety of challenges. Each round, the player helps the monkey climb his tree and chooses the power and angle of the monkey's coconut projectile in an attempt to hit the enemy monkey in an parallel tree. To defeat an enemy monkey, the enemy monkey's health must reach 0 before the player's monkey. Each victory results in an acquisition of a variety of items that the players can use to help their monkey and allow for fun gameplay.

I made this game as a final project for a CSCI151 Data Strucutes course that I took my freshman year of college. Although the use of a game engine could result in a higher quality game, this game (I still haven't decided on its title) effectively demonstrates a wide variety of data structures combining to form a substantial piece of software.
