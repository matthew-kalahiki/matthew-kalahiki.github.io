I've recently started working on the Hendrix Assessment Project. Because we technically started the Arkansas Asset Builders project over from scratch, this will be the first project that I've worked on that I haven't been a part of since the beginning. This said, it's been a somewhat difficult process figuring out all of the previously written code, but after meeting with Dr. Goadrich to go over everything, I now have a good sense of what needs to be done. I'm looking forward to getting things working properly.
