Since the last post, our team has made some decent progress.

I have continued working on linking the database to JavaFx, and I've had much success. At first, I struggled with finding an efficient way to use the data produced by the JDBC, but I found a good tutorial on using the JDBC API with JavaFx that works well.
The tutorial promts you to set up a model class and a Data Access Object (DAO) class for each table in the database. This type of organization is not only benefiecial because of its effeciency, but it is reflective of the Razor Pages template that we are already familiar with.

Furthermore, I got a sample of the Client table in our database to connect and display on the default Scene in the project, so once our scenes are complete, we can connect the database and move on to our next steps.
