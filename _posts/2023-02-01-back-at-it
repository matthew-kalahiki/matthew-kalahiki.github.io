After a long and much needed winter break, Disco Tray is back to work.
I pick up where I left off working on the Arkansas Asset Builders program that we hope to get finished by early February.
I recently finished making new models for the new Data Base schema and a Data Base Initialization method that makes a Data Base
If there isn't one already.

At the moment, I'm working on updating the filter menu and the tables to match our new Data Base Schema.

While we still have some work to do, the program is coming along very nicely, and we should be finished very soon.
