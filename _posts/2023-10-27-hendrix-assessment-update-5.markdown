This past week has been spent optimizing the performance of the Hendrix Assessment Project. Aside from cleaning up the code, I have been conducting in depth research on how to best optimize the queries to the database. From what I can tell, this is the primary reason from the long run time, so I'm doing my best to optimize the performance of our queries. As we approach the end of the semester, it is imperative that we get the software working as efficiently as possible as soon as possible so that teachers can use it.
