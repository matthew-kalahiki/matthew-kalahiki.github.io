Although I haven't provided an update in a while in regards to the Arkansas Assets Builders project, there has been some progress made.

After meeting with Dr. Yorgey, our team was able to get a better understanding of what needs to be implemented. For starters, we came to the conclusion that it would be better to convert the project from an asp.net application to a JavaFX project. Although, we will basically have to start from scratch, we concluded that the database from the previous project works for this one as well.

Thus far, we implemented the basic framework for our JavaFX program and a way to connect our SQLite database to the project.

Although we have a long way to go, I'm looking forward to working on this project for the foreseeable future.
