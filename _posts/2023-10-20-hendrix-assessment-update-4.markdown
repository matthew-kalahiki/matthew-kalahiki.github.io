Sadly, due to fall break, I missed my blog post last week, so there is quite a bit to catch up on. For starters, I fixed method for selecting the semester and year for the view data page of the Hendrix assessment project. Originally, the user chose a semester in the form of 1 or 2, with semester 2 of a given year actually occurring in the following year. This said, I now added the functionality for the user to selected either "Fall" or "Spring" and the actual years in which they took place. Although this seems like it should have been a simple task, attempting to figure out how to do it as efficiently and as readable as possible took a bit of trial and error.

Additionally, We created a new page for admin to be able to view all current surveys.
