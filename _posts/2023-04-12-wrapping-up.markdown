After much hard work, the project for Arkansas Asset Builders, now known as 'VITAmin', is coming to an end.
There's been a lot of trouble with merging the team's work, but the software now works. I have ran through the use cases provided by Dr. Yorgey, and every thing that she's looking for can be achieved by the software.
We still can't get the executable to work, so that's my next and possibly final goal, but none the less tremendous progress has been made thus far.
