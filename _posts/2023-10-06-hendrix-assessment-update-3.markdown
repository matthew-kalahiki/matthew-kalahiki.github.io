This past week, I was able to fix the export and visual functionality of the view results page of the Hendrix Assessment Project. After viewing the results for the given topic and year, there should be a chart that displays some statistics of the selected data, as well as the ability to download the data locally. This, however, was not working properly, but changing the methods that selected the chosen data and changing when the data is selected, I was able to get everything working.
