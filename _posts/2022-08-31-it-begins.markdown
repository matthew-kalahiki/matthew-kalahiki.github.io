I'm super excited to working with Disco Tray Studios this semester. This is my first full week working with them, and it has been an exciting experience thus far.

I've spent the majority of last week and the beginning of this week trying to professionalize my online presence. This includes updating my GitHub account, innovating and organizing my personal website, and adding my information to Disco Tray's website to make things official.

This week, I've started working on a project for Arkansas Asset Builders. I won't go into too much detail, but this project was started by a group of students in CSCI 340; however, given time constraints and evolving client needs, the project still has ways to go. This said, this week has been spent reviewing the current state of the project, and researching possible solutions to its current problems. Additionally, we have a meeting scheduled with our contact from Arkansas Asset Builders, Joyia Yorgey, to go over the future of the project.
