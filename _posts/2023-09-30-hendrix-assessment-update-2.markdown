I was able to separate the roles of admin and managers. The admin should have access to everything while managers should only have access to information regarding the topics they manage. I also added the ability to view the results of previous years and semesters. Until now, it was only possible to view the data of the current assessments, but now users can view the assessment results of previous years.
